# the-best-classifier
I loaded a historical Dataset from previous loan applications and applied different classifcation algorithms

Thefollowing algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classification algorithm, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoass
