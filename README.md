# The-best-classifier
I loaded a historical Dataset from previous loan applications and applied the following algorithms to build my models:

1. k-Nearest Neighbour

2. Decision Tree

3. Support Vector Machine

4. Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classification algorithm, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass.
